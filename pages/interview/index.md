We offer various internship opportunities for international students at world-renowned Japanese companies, NPOs/NGOs, local governments, and many others. Our program offers full support for studentsâ€™ internship experience from the start to the finish. We invite and encourage students to explore their career interests and gain valuable experiences off-campus by working in a different culture.
