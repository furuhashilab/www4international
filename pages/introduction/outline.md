## About GSC

The School of Global Studies and Collaboration (GSC) was established in 2015 with the goal of cultivating studentsâ€™ intellectual capacity and leadership to thrive in a rapidly changing globalized world. Students at GSC take courses from our four clusters: collaboration, sociology, business, and media and spatial information. This interdisciplinary curriculum ensures that students receive a holistic social science education that can be utilized in a wide variety of fields. GSC faculty members include a number of instructors with extensive records of practical experience in their respective fields and industries, and strive to provide students with the tools to connect theories taught in classrooms with real-world applications.
