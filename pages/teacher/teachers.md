## Geography
Geography courses explore the role that locations play in our daily lives. Since the advent of the Internet era, geospatial technology is quickly evolving to become faster, more accurate, and more tightly integrated into our experiences. Geography courses give students a chance to discover and help create state-of-the-art neo-geographic tools in Japan for generating and sharing geospatial information.

## Culture
Japanese Culture courses introduce students to numerous intriguing facets of Japanese culture, ranging from traditional art and belief to the “Cool Japan” of the 21st century. Students will have hands-on experiences such as traditional flower arrangement and tea ceremony, opportunities to meet actors from traditional theater such as Kabuki, and learn first-hand from anime artists and robot theater performers.

## History
Japanese History courses enrich students’ knowledge about Japan, its past and present. The courses cover a wide timeframe from the medieval period to modern times, as well as a broad range of topics including the political roles of the samurai, the rising status of women, and war memory. Students will gain an understanding of Japanese history through a hands-on approach by conducting fieldwork and trips around the campus.

## Economy, Business and Policy
Japanese Economy, Business and Policy courses aim to facilitate a precise understanding of key aspects of the Japanese economy among international students. The four courses cover the most essential elements that contributed to the reconstruction and development of the economy in the latter half of the 20th century, including private sector innovation, education, industrial policies, and economic cooperation with developing countries.
