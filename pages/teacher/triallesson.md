The Japan Studies Program offers a variety of field trips and excursions to popular Japanese destinations such as Mount Fuji and other UNESCO World Heritage sites as well opportunities for hands-on experiences of traditional and contemporary Japanese culture, from Noh and Kabuki to pop culture and robotics, inside and outside of the classroom. These events give students the chance to become familiar with numerous aspects of Japanâ€™s vibrant cultural heritage while building lasting connections with their Japanese peers. Our program also includes company visits, giving students the rare chance to go behind the scenes of innovative businesses.
